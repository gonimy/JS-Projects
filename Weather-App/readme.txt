Well at this simple side project i have apply some basics i have learned in JS and 
getting to know what API is and use the openWeatherMap API in order to get the weather in my city 

weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this,
an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit,
the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (London, GB).


When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
